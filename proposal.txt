ICS4U1 Project Proposal: Space RPG
Problem Description:
        	There have always been people with too much free time on their hands and nothing interesting to do. Many games have a campaign (main storyline / quests) however when that main story is finished the game loses all value, all the hard work that went into designing and implementing the game suddenly dissipates.
Proposed Solution:
Create an RPG game with RogueLike aspects, including randomly generated terrain, in order to increase replayability 
Functionality:
➢	Store player account information: levels, skills, inventory, etc.
➢	Retrieve, load player account information after verification through login system
➢	Store updates to scenes
➢	Retrieve scene information and load scenes
➢	Randomly generate quest maps and NPCs with difficulty based on player level and other factors such as player progression
➢	2D Turn-based combat
Target Market:
            Individuals of age 12+
Solution Mastery Aspects:
➢	OOP: classes for different types of players, maps, objects, etc.
○	Encapsulation: game object classes will have private fields
○	Polymorphism: actions that may happen to a group of game objects (e.g. consumables) will be applied to the general type
○	Inheritance: specialized game objects will extend a general type (e.g. a Berry class might extend a Food class)
➢	Array of Objects: arrays of NPC, objects in each quest scene
➢	File Input: load player, scene information
➢	File Output: save player, game information
➢	Sorting: sort inventory lexicography or by item type  
➢	Searching: searching for items in inventory
➢	Recursion: generating maps, in combat (if enemy is not dead, call method again), finding paths
