ICS4U Project Proposal: Space RPG

Problem Description:
        There have always been people with too much free time on their hands and nothing interesting to do.
	
Proposed Solution:
	Create an RPG game for bored people to play.
	
Functionality:
	Store player account information: levels, skills, inventory, etc.
	Retrieve, load player account information after verification through login system
	Store updates to scenes
	Retrieve scene information and load scenes
	Randomly generate quest maps (temporary) and monsters with difficulty based on player level
	Turn-based combat
	
Target Market:
        Bored individuals of any age.
	
Solution Mastery Aspects:
	OOP: classes for different types of players, maps, objects, etc.
		Encapsulation: game object classes will have private fields
		Polymorphism: actions that may happen to a group of game objects (e.g. consumables) will be applied to the general type
		Inheritance: specialized game objects will extend a general type (e.g. a Berry class might extend a Food class)
	Array of Objects: arrays of monsters, objects in each quest scene
	File Input: load player, scene information
	File Output: save player, game information
	Sorting: sort inventory
	Searching: searching for information of specific player to load
	Recursion: generating maps, in combat (if enemy is not dead, call method again), finding paths
